cert-manager 1.16 includes various improvements to the metrics in the cert-manager components.

## Themes

### Extended Metrics

The webhook and cainjector components now have metrics servers,
so that platform teams can monitor the performance of all the cert-manager components
and gain more information about the underlying Go runtime in the event of a problem.
Read the [Prometheus Metrics](../../devops-tips/prometheus-metrics.md) page to learn more.
