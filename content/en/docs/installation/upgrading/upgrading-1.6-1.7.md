âš  Following their deprecation in version 1.5, the cert-manager API versions v1alpha2, v1alpha3, and v1beta1 have been removed.
You must ensure that all cert-manager custom resources are stored in etcd at version v1
and that all cert-manager `CustomResourceDefinition`s have only v1 as the stored version
**before** upgrading.
Please read [Migrating Deprecated API Resources] for full instructions.
