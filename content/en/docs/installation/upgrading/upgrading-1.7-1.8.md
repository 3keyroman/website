When upgrading from 1.7 to 1.8, no special upgrade steps are required ðŸŽ‰. From
here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](../).

#### Validation of the `rotationPolicy` field

The field `spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy` on Certificate resources is now validated. Valid options are Never and Always.

Before upgrading to 1.8.0, you will need to check that all the Certificate YAML manifests you have stored in Git if you are using a GitOps flow (or any other "source of truth") have a correct `rotationPolicy` value. To help you find out which Certificate YAML manifests need updating, you can run the following command:

```sh
kubectl get cert -A -ojson | jq -r \
  '.items[] | select(.spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy | . != "Always" and . != "Never") | "\(.metadata.name) in namespace \(.metadata.namespace) has rotationPolicy=\(.spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy)"'
```

This command will show you, the name and namespace of each Certificate resource that needs to be updated in Git. For example:

```text
smoketest-cert in namespace default has rotationPolicy=Foo
```

#### Server-Side Apply

Server-Side Apply is an alpha feature of cert-manager introduced in 1.8. By
default, the feature is disabled, in which case you do not need to do any
upgrade steps.

If you are using Server-Side Apply, i.e., you are running the cert-manager
controller with the flag

```text
--feature-gates=ServerSideApply=true
```

Then you need to take action before upgrading to cert-manger 1.8. You will have
to make sure that there are no Challenge resources currently in the cluster. If
there are some, you will need to manually delete them once they are in a 'valid'
state.

The reason the Challenge resources need to be removed before upgrading to 1.8
when using the new Server-Side Apply feature is that cert-manager post-1.8 is
not able to clean up Challenge resources that were created pre-1.8.
